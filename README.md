# Hi, I'm Kartick

I'm a self-taught Machine Learning enthusiast with a strong foundation in PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning, and NLP. Currently focusing on real-world ML applications and contributing to open-source.

## Open Source Contributions

### Hugging Face Transformers

- Remove deprecated max_size support from YOLOS image processor #38923
- My first contribution, cleaning up legacy logic in vision preprocessing. Currently working toward deeper fixes in the training loop and evaluation flow.

## Goals

- Contribute core-level improvements to Transformers and Diffusers
- Build real-world RL applications
- Land an ML Engineer role focused on generative models or agent-based systems
